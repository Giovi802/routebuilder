routebuilder for BVE used to be a route building editor for the train simulator BVE. This is the base project for creating a new generation of routebuilder, propably useful for openBVE.

The original authors donate the project to the community and make it open sourced. But they are not involved in further development nor can answer any questions about existing code.
Only one thing: You will need Borland Delphi 7 for Windows or Microsoft Visual C# 2008 to compile and built upon the existing code.
